This program is now designed to work with EPGCollector.  EPGCollector is a prerequisite.  The EPGCollector DLLs are required to be
in the directory with EPG.exe, as well as a file called "EPG Collector.ini".  This file can be built, with 
EPGCentre, the GUI for EPGCollector.

A sample of EPG Collector.ini is also included.
